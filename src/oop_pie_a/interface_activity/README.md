# Our First Interface

* For this activity you are tasked to create a Class that implements the Animal interface. 
* Create any kind of animal you would like as a Class and have it implement Animal. You will immediately see that you get an error on your Class, this is because the interface requires you to create the methods from it.
* The Animal interface has 3 methods in total and 1 attribute. You don't need to do anything to the Animal interface.
* Override the methods that you are supposed to and give them the necessary code to complete the contract with the interface.
* Once you are no longer getting error messages in your created Class, go to the Nature class and follow the comments in the main() method.
