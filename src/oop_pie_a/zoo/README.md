# Zoo

* For this activity you are tasked to create a Zoo. Your Zoo is going to be home to some different Animals. 
* Start by creating any child Class of Animal that you would like. Example: Bird, Bear, Monkey, Cat
   - Give the child Class a couple instance fields specific to the animal itself and at least 1 method.
   - Override the makeSound() method from the parent class so that it is more specific to your animal.
   - Create an instance of your class in the main() method of the Zoo class and test out the instance fields and methods you created.
   - After you create the instance of your child class you should be able to use the addAnimalToZoo() method and get a successful response in the console.
* If you still have time then create another child Class of animal and keep practicing.
