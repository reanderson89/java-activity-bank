//        Create an ArrayList with 5 elements and give the value in-line
//        mess around with various methods for ArrayLists. Just type out the variable name and then put a "." and scroll through the list of methods.
//        read the information it shows you and try to figure out how to use it.
//        create different conditionals using "if-else" statements to test different methods. For example:
//        if (myArray.contains("something"){
//        then do something
//        }
//        print out whatever you need to the terminal to check and see if the methods work the way you think they should.
